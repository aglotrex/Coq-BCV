(** This file is a set of tactical (mainly "!! t" where t is a tactic)
    and tactics (!intros, !destruct etc), that automatically rename
    new hypothesis after applying a tactic. The names chosen for
    hypothesis is programmable using Ltac. See examples in comment
    below.

    Comments welcome. *)

(** ** The custom renaming tactic
  This tactic should be redefined along a coq development, it should
  return a fresh name build from an hypothesis h and its type th. It
  should fail if no name is found, so that the fallback scheme is
  called.

  Typical use, in increasing order of complexity, approximatively
  equivalent to the decreasing order of interest.
